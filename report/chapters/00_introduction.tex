\section{Introduction}
\label{ch:introduction}

This report covers our project of converting a Python flask application called MiniTwit
into a modern \texttt{.NET} application using the latest technologies. In summary, the application allows users to register and post messages,  which are then displayed on a timeline for everyone to see.

The project was part of the course \textit{DevOps, Software Evolution and Software Maintenance} course during spring 2025 at the IT University of Copenhagen. The report will cover how various tools, workflows and technologies where implemented and used to help setting up continuous integration (\texttt{CI}) and continuous deployment (\texttt{CD}) pipelines while keeping a focus on
software qualities like maintainability.
