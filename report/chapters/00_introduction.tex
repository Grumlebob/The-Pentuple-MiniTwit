\section{Introduction}
\label{ch:introduction}

This report covers our project of converting a Python flask application 
into a modern .NET application using the latest technologies.

The appilcation is called MiniTwit. 
It is an application where users can register and post messages, 
which are then displayed on a timeline for all users to see.

The project was part of the ITU DevOps course 2025 and 
required various tools, workflows, and technologies. 
The main focus was on continuous integration (CI) 
and continuous deployment (CD), as well as 
software qualities like maintainability.
This report covers how all these things where included.
