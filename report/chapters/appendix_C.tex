\section{Reasons for tool choices}
\label{appn:C}
It is important to state, that our group agreed that 
job prospects and learning within \texttt{.NET} enviroment was a goal.
As such, one main motivator was, what is commonly used in 
the \texttt{.NET} industry.
As such, choices such as using \texttt{.NET} Minimal API,
was quite obvious.

\subsection{Infrastructure as code}

We debated using \texttt{Pulumi}\cite{pulumi} vs \texttt{Terraform}.
\texttt{Pulumi} is a newer tool, with a \texttt{.NET} SDK, 
making the language more native to what we are used to.
But none of us could find any job postings that used \texttt{Pulumi}.
So we decided to use \texttt{Terraform}, which is more widely used 
in the industry.


\subsection{Blazor vs MVC}
We wanted to send smaller json data instead of full HTML pages. 
Blazor is newer and higher performance. By using Blazor WASM, 
the client loads the code upon initial visit,
and uses json data sent by our minimal API, to render the HTML Pages.
This is alternative to using ASP.NET MVC, which would require the server
to render full HTML pages on site requests.

\subsection{GitHub and GitHub actions}
Everyone had experience, and found no learning to be 
gained from switching to example \texttt{gitlab} and \texttt{Jenkins}.

\subsection{Hybrid cache}
We noticed the simulator made several reads sequentially without a write, 
mamaking caching quite benificial. Hybrid cache supports both local 
caching and distributed for example through \texttt{Redis}\cite{redis}. 
We planned to do Redis, but it is still in the backlog.

\subsection{Testcontainers and respawn}
As we are refactoring code, testing is insanely 
useful, so we don't regress. 
We wanted to do integration testing, to avoid mocking. 
Testcointainers is also directly supported in github actions, 
and as such makes contionuous integration a breeze.

\subsection{Minimal API vs controllers}
We had both at some point. Minimal api is newer, more performant, 
and easy to read and write. Therefore we refactored the code, 
to only have minimal API endpoints.

\subsection{PostgreSQL}
\texttt{PostgreSQL} is free, and was part of the database course we all
took. We found learning about a different databases to be 
out of scope for this course. Aswell as going from sqlite 
being a relationship based database, we did not want to 
switch to for example a document based DB.

\subsection{Seq}
We wanted to use a log server, and Seq is made for .NET.
It is easy to set up, has a nice UI, and is widely used 
in the industry.

\subsection{Docker Swarm}
We had a hard time following the course alongside the other 
courses at the moment this part of the project was ongoing.
Therefore we did not debate any alternatives, and followed 
the course guide. We only heard \texttt{Kubernetes} mentioned in 
the course, but as being ``highly advised against using''.

\subsection{DigitalOcean}
We are poor students, using 7 taped together calculatores 
as a computer. Digital Ocean was free with the github student 
credits, this made it an easy choice.
