### Initialization

The initial files like main.tex /build folder /images folder etc was added in report folder as per instructions from https://github.com/itu-devops/lecture_notes/blob/master/REPORT.md

In vs code there is an extension for latex called LaTeX Workshop. To get this to work install mikLatex and Perl.

The workflow has a new file called ```generate-report.yml``` which generates the pdf on push to main.
